            "3. Check the modem: If your modem is separate from the router, ensure that it is also powered on and connected correctly.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Check other devices: If only one device is facing WiFi issues, try connecting other devices to your WiFi network. If they can connect successfully, then the problem is likely specific to the device facing issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Check signal strength: Move closer to your router and see if the WiFi signal improves. If you are far away or there are obstructions between your device and the router, the signal strength may be weak.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Reset network settings: If you are experiencing connectivity issues on a specific device, try resetting the network settings. This will remove any WiFi configurations or settings that might be causing the problem.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. Update router firmware: Ensure that your router's firmware is up to date. Manufacturers often release updates to fix bugs and improve performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. Check for interference: Other devices or appliances in your home, such as cordless phones or microwave ovens, can interfere with WiFi signals. Make sure your router is placed away from such devices.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. Contact your ISP: If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it might be a problem with your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Contact them to check if there are any outages or issues from their end.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you are still unable to resolve the issue, it might be best to contact your Internet Service Provider or seek further technical assistance.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Locate the reset button: Most routers have a small reset button located on the back or bottom. It is usually recessed to prevent accidental presses.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Press and hold the reset button: Use a paperclip or a small, pointed object to press and hold the reset button for about 10-15 seconds. Make sure to hold the button until you see the router's lights flash or until the router restarts.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Release the reset button: After the router restarts, release the reset button.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Wait for the router to boot up: Give your router a few minutes to boot up and complete its startup process. During this time, the lights on the router will typically blink or remain solid, indicating normal operation.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Reconfigure your router: After the reset, your router is back to its default settings, including the network name (SSID) and password. You will need to reconnect to the router using its default WiFi network name and password or reconfigure the settings as per your requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "Note: Resetting your router will erase any customized settings you made, including WiFi passwords, port forwarding configurations, and any other customizations. Be sure to create backups of your important settings if needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you are unsure about resetting your specific router model or need more specific instructions, consult your router's user manual or contact the manufacturer's support for assistance.\n",
            "Here are some general troubleshooting steps to resolve common internet issues:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Check the modem and router: Ensure that both the modem and router (if separate) are powered on and connected correctly. Make sure all cables are securely plugged in.\n",
